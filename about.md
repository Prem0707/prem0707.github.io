**Prem Singh** 

Currently, I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus pursing Bachelor in Pharmacy (B.Pharm). Iâ€™m a avid and enthusiatic programmer with a strong experience in Java and Android. I also have experience in Python and C programming.

 I am a self-learned programmer, and I learned programming so that I can use technology to make an impact on common lives.
